# todoReactApp
A todolist created using React.js and much much more.....

OVERVIEW:

This static web app with no backend has been created mainly using React.Js. 
Every component you see has been custom created. 
Some unique and complex React concepts such as ReactHooks (useState), props, map/filter/reduce, and many others have been used. 
This project took atleast 12 hrs.(With breaks ofcourse). I hope you like it. There is more to come.

INSTRUCTIONS:

If you want to test it go ahead and clone my repository.Then follows these steps:
1. Extract the files to a specific folder.
2. Open your Command Line Interface. You can use CMD on Windows or SHELL if you are on Linux. Alternatively, you can also use Hyper Terminal if you have that installed.
3. cd into your extracted project directory.
4. Run command 'npm install'. This will install the required React, ReactDOM and other required modules necessary for the App to run.
5. After it's done, run command 'npm start'. A new browser window will pop out. Your App is now active.
6. In the input area, write a note and click ADD button. The note will appear in the list. And if you click it, it will be removed from the list.
